# Screen Pinger

Allows you to ping your screen like in League of Legends the game

## Usage

Ping: Hold Alt + Left click

Close: Open system tray -> Right Click -> Quit

## TODO

- different pings

- mouse swipe to select ping type

- config (activation method)

## Install

Windows detects it as a virus (makes sense given how inputs are captured) so the esiest way is to just `cargo install --git https://github.com/HichuYamichu/screen-pinger`. Move it wherever you want and copy assets folder from this repo next to exe.
